Recorded by Piotr Barcz from a Francis Bacon player piano. It's a wonderful historic piano with an authentic honky-tonk tone.

The sounds were recorded in stereo with a Zoom H1n sound recorder, at the approximate position where the pianist's head would be, and they were sent to FreePats on February 2020. It's quite difficult to find pianos like this nowadays, many thanks to Piotr for sharing these samples with us.
